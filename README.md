These are "default" configs for the Rook printers, I'll be adding more too the list as I get too it.

For now, theres 3 configs for the Rook MK1.
They are all based on the LDO kit, and ONLY THE M4P oone is tested.
The MINI and PICOO oonbes are just copies oof the M4P config with the pins renamed for the other boards.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, NO GUARANTEES THAT THEY WILL WORK!

If you use any of these, let me know if you have to make any changes and I'll update my configs.
